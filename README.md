# Pre-Assessment Spring Starter

## Usage
This starter utilizes Gradle as its build tool. After cloning and changing into its directory, open the the project in your IDE of choice. IntelliJ Idea Community Edition is recommended, however you may wish to use Visual Code Studio if it is set up for Java development with the correct extensions.

Please refer to the [Gradle Wrapper docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) for further info on building, running, and testing the application.

Simple use cases will involve these commands:
- `./gradlew bootRun` to start the Tomcat server with your application
- `./gradlew test -i` in order to run your tests and see the output in the terminal
- `./gradlew build` to create a build of the application for use in web server or deployment

You can leverage the UI in your IDE to run these tasks as well.
